### Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering Techniques

K-Means clustering is a machine learning technique used for unsupervised data clustering and partitioning. It aims to group similar data points together into clusters, with the number of clusters (k) predefined by the user. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and recalculates the centroids until convergence, minimizing the distance between data points and their assigned centroids. K-Means is widely used in data analysis and segmentation tasks, helping to discover patterns and relationships within datasets. It's applicable to various domains, including customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

Applied K-Means to undesignated customer data to identify and group common features of customers who have churned. The data consists of 10,000 records and focuses specifically on customers who are no longer with a company due to churn.

### Principal Component Analysis


Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in data analysis and machine learning. It aims to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving the most important information by identifying orthogonal axes (principal components) along which the data varies the most, allowing for simplified visualization and analysis of complex datasets.

Performed PCA on a dataset to decrease dimensionality and assess the importance of each principal component by retaining maximum variance. Used the reduced dataset generated by PCA to construct a decision tree classifier and evaluate its effectiveness in forecasting churn clients.

### Market Basket Analysis


Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used in retail and marketing to discover patterns and relationships between products frequently purchased together by customers. It identifies associations or item sets within transactional data, helping businesses understand customer behavior, optimize product placement, and create targeted marketing strategies to increase sales and customer satisfaction.

Currently, due to nationwide pharmacy shortages, patients face the choice of abruptly changing their medication or waiting for weeks unless they are willing to pay high prices for brand-name drugs. By analyzing purchasing patterns and co-prescriptions of 'amphetamine salt combo xr,' we can identify frequently purchased alternative medications. Recommending these substitutes to patients or physicians ensures they receive necessary treatment during medication shortages.

### Time Series Modeling


Time Series Modeling is a statistical technique used to analyze and forecast data points collected or recorded at regular time intervals. It involves capturing patterns, trends, and seasonality within time-ordered data to make predictions or gain insights into future values or behaviors.

The aim of this analysis is to achieve precise daily revenue predictions for United Hospital by leveraging the available dataset. The methodology entails utilizing the first 80% of the dataset as a training set to forecast the subsequent 20% (test set). By employing observed values for comparative analysis instead of making future projections, we can effectively conduct an evaluation within the confines of this dataset. To accomplish this, we will employ an ARIMA time series model to accurately project the remaining 20% of data values, building upon the insights gained from analyzing the initial 80% of the data.
