### Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering Techniques

K-Means clustering is a machine learning technique used for unsupervised data clustering and partitioning. It aims to group similar data points together into clusters, with the number of clusters (k) predefined by the user. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and recalculates the centroids until convergence, minimizing the distance between data points and their assigned centroids. K-Means is widely used in data analysis and segmentation tasks, helping to discover patterns and relationships within datasets. It's applicable to various domains, including customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

Applied K-Means to undesignated customer data to identify and group common features of customers who have churned. The data consists of 10,000 records and focuses specifically on customers who are no longer with a company due to churn.
