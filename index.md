### Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering Techniques

K-Means clustering is a machine learning technique used for unsupervised data clustering and partitioning. It aims to group similar data points together into clusters, with the number of clusters (k) predefined by the user. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and recalculates the centroids until convergence, minimizing the distance between data points and their assigned centroids. K-Means is widely used in data analysis and segmentation tasks, helping to discover patterns and relationships within datasets. It's applicable to various domains, including customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

Applied K-Means to undesignated customer data to identify and group common features of customers who have churned. The data consists of 10,000 records and focuses specifically on customers who are no longer with a company due to churn.

### Principal Component Analysis


Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in data analysis and machine learning. It aims to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving the most important information by identifying orthogonal axes (principal components) along which the data varies the most, allowing for simplified visualization and analysis of complex datasets.

Performed PCA on a dataset to decrease dimensionality and assess the importance of each principal component by retaining maximum variance. Used the reduced dataset generated by PCA to construct a decision tree classifier and evaluate its effectiveness in forecasting churn clients.

### Market Basket Analysis


Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used in retail and marketing to discover patterns and relationships between products frequently purchased together by customers. It identifies associations or item sets within transactional data, helping businesses understand customer behavior, optimize product placement, and create targeted marketing strategies to increase sales and customer satisfaction.

Currently, due to nationwide pharmacy shortages, patients face the choice of abruptly changing their medication or waiting for weeks unless they are willing to pay high prices for brand-name drugs. By analyzing purchasing patterns and co-prescriptions of 'amphetamine salt combo xr,' we can identify frequently purchased alternative medications. Recommending these substitutes to patients or physicians ensures they receive necessary treatment during medication shortages.
